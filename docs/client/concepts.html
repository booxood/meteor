We've written our fair share of single-page JavaScript applications by hand.
Writing an entire application in one language (JavaScript) with one
data format (JSON) is a real joy.  Meteor is everything we wanted
when writing those apps.

<h2 id="structuringyourapp">Structuring your application</h2>

A Meteor application is a mix of JavaScript that runs inside a client web
browser, JavaScript that runs on the Meteor server inside a
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) container, and all the supporting HTML fragments,
CSS rules, and static assets.  Meteor automates the packaging and transmission
of these different components.  And, it is quite flexible about how you choose
to structure those components in your file tree.

The only server asset is JavaScript.  Meteor gathers all your JavaScript
files, excluding anything under the `client`
and `public` subdirectories, and loads them into a Node.js
server instance inside a fiber.  In Meteor, your server code runs in
a single thread per request, not in the asynchronous callback style
typical of Node.  We find the linear execution model a better fit for
the typical server code in a Meteor application.

There are more assets to consider on the client side.  Meteor
gathers all JavaScript files in your tree with the exception of
the `server` and `public` subdirectories for the
client.  It minifies this bundle and serves it to each new client.
You're free to use a single JavaScript file for your entire application, or
create a nested tree of separate files, or anything in between.

Some JavaScript libraries only work when placed in the
`client/compatibility` subdirectory.  Files in this directory are
executed without being wrapped in a new variable scope.  This means
that each top-level `var` defines a global variable. In addition,
these files are executed before other client-side JavaScript files.

Files outside the `client`, `server` and `tests` subdirectories are loaded on
both the client and the server!  That's the place for model definitions and
other functions.  Meteor provides the variables [`isClient`](#meteor_isclient) and
[`isServer`](#meteor_isserver) so that your code can alter its behavior depending
on whether it's running on the client or the server. (Files in directories named
`tests` are not loaded anywhere.)

Any sensitive code that you don't want served to the client, such as code
containing passwords or authentication mechanisms, should be
kept in the `server` directory.

CSS files are gathered together as well: the client will get a bundle with all
the CSS in your tree (excluding the `server`
and `public` subdirectories).

In development mode, JavaScript and CSS files are sent individually to make
debugging easier.

HTML files in a Meteor application are treated quite a bit differently
from a server-side framework.  Meteor scans all the HTML files in your
directory for three top-level elements: `<head>`, `<body>`, and
`<template>`.  The head and body sections are separately concatenated
into a single head and body, which are transmitted to the client on
initial page load.

Template sections, on the other hand, are converted into JavaScript
functions, available under the `Template` namespace.  It's
a really convenient way to ship HTML templates to the client.
See the [templates](#templates) section for more.

Lastly, the Meteor server will serve any files under the `public`
directory, just like in a Rails or Django project.  This is the place
for images, `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, and anything else.

It is best to write your application in such a way that it is
insensitive to the order in which files are loaded, for example by
using [Meteor.startup](#meteor_startup), or by moving load order
sensitive code into [Smart Packages](#smartpackages), which can explicitly control both
the load order of their contents and their load order with respect to
other packages. However sometimes load order dependencies in your
application are unavoidable. The JavaScript and CSS files in an
application are loaded according to these rules:

* Files in the `lib` directory at the root of your application are
  loaded first.

* Files that match `main.*` are loaded after everything else.

* Files in subdirectories are loaded before files in parent
  directories, so that files in the deepest subdirectory are loaded
  first (after `lib`), and files in the root directory are loaded last
  (other than `main.*`).

* Within a directory, files are loaded in alphabetical order by
  filename.

These rules stack, so that within `lib`, for example, files are still
loaded in alphabetical order; and if there are multiple files named
`main.js`, the ones in subdirectories are loaded earlier.

<template name="data">
{{#better_markdown}}

<h2 id="dataandsecurity">Data and security</h2>

Meteor makes writing distributed client code as simple as talking to a
local database.  It's a clean, simple, and secure approach that obviates
the need to implement individual RPC endpoints, manually cache data on
the client to avoid slow roundtrips to the server, and carefully
orchestrate invalidation messages to every client as data changes.

In Meteor, the client and server share the same database API.  The same
exact application code &mdash; like validators and computed properties &mdash; can
often run in both places.  But while code running on the server has
direct access to the database, code running on the client does *not*.
This distinction is the basis for Meteor's data security model.

{{#note}}
By default, a new Meteor app includes the `autopublish` and `insecure`
packages, which together mimic the effect of each client having full
read/write access to the server's database.  These are useful
prototyping tools, but typically not appropriate for production
applications.  When you're ready, just remove the packages.
{{/note}}

Every Meteor client includes an in-memory database cache.  To manage the
client cache, the server *publishes* sets of JSON documents, and the
client *subscribes* to those sets.  As documents in a set change, the
server patches each client's cache.

Today most Meteor apps use MongoDB as their database because it is the
best supported, though support for other databases is coming in the
future. The
[`Meteor.Collection`](http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_collection) class
is used to declare Mongo collections and to manipulate them. Thanks to
`minimongo`, Meteor's client-side Mongo emulator, `Meteor.Collection`
can be used from both client and server code.

    // declare collections
    // this code should be included in both the client and the server
    Rooms = new Meteor.Collection("rooms");
    Messages = new Meteor.Collection("messages");
    Parties = new Meteor.Collection("parties");

    // server: populate collections with some initial documents
    Rooms.insert({name: "Conference Room A"});
    var myRooms = Rooms.find({}).fetch();
    Messages.insert({text: "Hello world", room: myRooms[0]._id});
    Parties.insert({name: "Super Bowl Party"});

Each document set is defined by a publish function on the server.  The
publish function runs each time a new client subscribes to a document
set.  The data in a document set can come from anywhere, but the common
case is to publish a database query.

    // server: publish all room documents
    Meteor.publish("all-rooms", function () {
      return Rooms.find(); // everything
    });

    // server: publish all messages for a given room
    Meteor.publish("messages", function (roomId) {
      check(roomId, String);
      return Messages.find({room: roomId});
    });

    // server: publish the set of parties the logged-in user can see.
    Meteor.publish("parties", function () {
      return Parties.find({$or: [{"public": true},
                                 {invited: this.userId},
                                 {owner: this.userId}]});
    });

Publish functions can provide different results to each client.  In the
last example, a logged in user can only see `Party` documents that
are public, that the user owns, or that the user has been invited to.

Once subscribed, the client uses its cache as a fast local database,
dramatically simplifying client code.  Reads never require a costly
round trip to the server.  And they're limited to the contents of the
cache: a query for every document in a collection on a client will only
return documents the server is publishing to that client.

    // client: start a parties subscription
    Meteor.subscribe("parties");

    // client: return array of Parties this client can read
    return Parties.find().fetch(); // synchronous!

Sophisticated clients can turn subscriptions on and off to control how
much data is kept in the cache and manage network traffic.  When a
subscription is turned off, all its documents are removed from the cache
unless the same document is also provided by another active
subscription.

When the client *changes* one or more documents, it sends a message to
the server requesting the change.  The server checks the proposed change
against a set of allow/deny rules you write as JavaScript functions.
The server only accepts the change if all the rules pass.

    // server: don't allow client to insert a party
    Parties.allow({
      insert: function (userId, party) {
        return false;
      }
    });

    // client: this will fail
    var party = { ... };
    Parties.insert(party);

If the server accepts the change, it applies the change to the database
and automatically propagates the change to other clients subscribed to
the affected documents.  If not, the update fails, the server's database
remains untouched, and no other client sees the update.

Meteor has a cute trick, though.  When a client issues a write to the
server, it also updates its local cache immediately, without waiting for
the server's response.  This means the screen will redraw right away.
If the server accepted the update &mdash; what ought to happen most of the
time in a properly behaving client &mdash; then the client got a jump on the
change and didn't have to wait for the round trip to update its own
screen.  If the server rejects the change, Meteor patches up the
client's cache with the server's result.

Putting it all together, these techniques accomplish latency
compensation.  Clients hold a fresh copy of the data they need, and
never need to wait for a roundtrip to the server. And when clients
modify data, those modifications can run locally without waiting for the
confirmation from the server, while still giving the server final say
over the requested change.

<h3 id="dataandsecurity-authentication">Authentication and user accounts</h3>

Meteor includes [Meteor Accounts](#accounts_api), a state-of-the-art
authentication system. It features secure password login using the
[Secure Remote Password
protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol),
and integration with external services including Facebook, GitHub,
Google, Meetup, Twitter, and Weibo. Meteor Accounts defines a
[`Meteor.users`](#meteor_users) collection where developers can store
application-specific user data.

Meteor also includes pre-built forms for common tasks like login, signup,
password change, and password reset emails. You can add [Accounts
UI](#accountsui) to your app with just one line of code. The `accounts-ui` smart
package even provides a configuration wizard that walks you through the steps to
set up the external login services you're using in your app.

{{#note}}
The current release of Meteor supports MongoDB, the popular document
database, and the examples in this section use the
        [MongoDB API](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Manual).  Future
releases will include support for other databases.
{{/note}}


<h3 id="dataandsecurity-validation">Input validation</h3>

Meteor allows your methods and publish functions to take arguments of any
[JSON](http://json.org/) type. (In fact, Meteor's wire protocol supports
[EJSON](#ejson), an extension of JSON which also supports other common types
like dates and binary buffers.) JavaScript's dynamic typing means you don't need
to declare precise types of every variable in your app, but it's usually helpful
to ensure that the arguments that clients are passing to your methods and
publish functions are of the type that you expect.

Meteor provides a [lightweight library](#match) for checking that arguments and
other values are the type you expect them to be. Simply start your functions
with statements like `check(username, String)` or
`check(office, {building: String, room: Number})`. The `check` call will
throw an error if its argument is of an unexpected type.

Meteor also provides an easy way to make sure that all of your methods
and publish functions validate all of their arguments. Just run
<code>meteor add [audit-argument-checks](#auditargumentchecks)</code> and any
method or publish function which skips `check`ing any of its arguments will fail
with an exception.

<template name="reactivity">
{{#better_markdown}}

<h2 id="reactivity">Reactivity</h2>

Meteor embraces the concept of [reactive
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming). This means that
you can write your code in a simple imperative style, and the result will be
automatically recalculated whenever data changes that your code depends on.

    Deps.autorun(function () {
      Meteor.subscribe("messages", Session.get("currentRoomId"));
    });

This example (taken from a chat room client) sets up a data
subscription based on the session variable `currentRoomId`.
If the value of `Session.get("currentRoomId")` changes for any reason, the
function will be automatically re-run, setting up a new subscription that
replaces the old one.

This automatic recomputation is achieved by a cooperation between
`Session` and `Deps.autorun`.  `Deps.autorun` performs an arbitrary "reactive
computation" inside of which data dependencies are tracked, and it
will re-run its function argument as necessary.  Data providers like
`Session`, on the other hand, make note of the computation they are
called from and what data was requested, and they are prepared to send
an invalidation signal to the computation when the data changes.

This simple pattern (reactive computation + reactive data source) has wide
applicability.  Above, the programmer is saved from writing
unsubscribe/resubscribe calls and making sure they are called at the
right time.  In general, Meteor can eliminate whole classes of data
propagation code which would otherwise clog up your application with
error-prone logic.

These Meteor functions run your code as a reactive computation:

* [Templates](#templates)
* [`Meteor.render`](#meteor_render) and [`Meteor.renderList`](#meteor_renderlist)
* [`Deps.autorun`](#deps_autorun)

And the reactive data sources that can trigger changes are:

* [`Session`](#session) variables
* Database queries on [Collections](#find)
* [`Meteor.status`](#meteor_status)
* The `ready()` method on a [subscription handle](#meteor_subscribe)
* [`Meteor.user`](#meteor_user)
* [`Meteor.userId`](#meteor_userid)
* [`Meteor.loggingIn`](#meteor_loggingin)

In addition, the following functions which return an object with a
`stop` method, if called from a reactive computation, are stopped when
the computation is rerun or stopped:

* [`Deps.autorun`](#deps_autorun) (nested)
* [`Meteor.subscribe`](#meteor_subscribe)
* [`observe()`](#observe) and [`observeChanges()`](#observe_changes) on cursors

Meteor's
[implementation](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/packages/deps/deps.js)
is a package called [`Deps`](#deps) that is fairly short and straightforward.
You can use it yourself to implement new reactive data sources.

{{/better_markdown}}
</template>

<template name="livehtml">
{{#better_markdown}}

<h2 id="livehtml">Live HTML</h2>

HTML templating is central to web applications. With Meteor's live
page update technology, you can render your HTML _reactively_, meaning
that it will update automatically to track changes in the data used to
generate it.

This optional feature works with any HTML templating library, or even
with HTML you generate manually from JavaScript. Here's an example:

    var fragment = Meteor.render(
      function () {
        var name = Session.get("name") || "Anonymous";
        return "<div>Hello, " + name + "</div>";
      });
    document.body.appendChild(fragment);

    Session.set("name", "Bob"); // page updates automatically!

[`Meteor.render`](#meteor_render) takes a rendering function, that is, a
function that returns some HTML as a string. It returns an auto-updating
`DocumentFragment`. When there is a change to data used by the rendering
function, it is re-run. The DOM nodes in the `DocumentFragment` then
update themselves in-place, no matter where they were inserted on the
page. It's completely automatic. [`Meteor.render`](#meteor_render) uses
a [reactive computation](#reactivity) to discover what data is used by the
rendering function.

Most of the time, though, you won't call these functions directly
&mdash; you'll just use your favorite templating package, such as
Handlebars or Jade. The `render` and `renderList` functions are intended
for people that are implementing new templating systems.

Meteor normally batches up any needed updates and executes them only
when your code isn't running. That way, you can be sure that the DOM
won't change out from underneath you. Sometimes you want the opposite
behavior. For example, if you've just inserted a record in the
database, you might want to force the DOM to update so you can find
the new elements using a library like jQuery. In that case, call
[`Deps.flush`](#deps_flush) to bring the DOM up to date
immediately.

When live-updating DOM elements are taken off the screen, they are automatically
cleaned up &mdash; their callbacks are torn down, any associated database
queries are stopped, and they stop updating. For this reason, you never have to
worry about the [zombie
templates](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/15/zombies-run-managing-page-transitions-in-backbone-apps/)
that plague hand-written update logic. To protect your elements from cleanup,
just make sure that they are on-screen before your code returns to the event loop,
or before any call you make to [`Deps.flush`](#deps_flush).

Another thorny problem in hand-written applications is element
preservation. Suppose the user is typing text into an `<input>`
element, and then the area of the page that includes that element is
redrawn. The user could be in for a bumpy ride, as the focus, the
cursor position, the partially entered text, and the accented
character input state will be lost when the `<input>` is recreated.

This is another problem that Meteor solves for you. You can specify
elements to preserve when templates are re-rendered with the
[`preserve`](#template_preserve) directive on the template. Meteor will
preserve these elements even when their enclosing template is
rerendered, but will still update their children and copy over any
attribute changes.

<template name="templates">
{{#better_markdown}}

<h2 id="templates">模板</h2>

Meteor 的实时页面更新技术可以使你很轻松地使用你喜欢的 HTML 模板语言，
像 Handlebars 和 Jade。只要如往常一样写你的模板，Meteor 会负责即时更新
它。

要使用这个特性，在你的项目中使用扩展名 `.html` 创建一个文件。在文件中，
构造一个 `<template>` 标签并给它一个 `name` 属性。在标签中放置模板内容。
Meteor 会预编译模板，运送它到客户端，然后使它可以在全局 `Template`
对象中作为一个有效的函数。


{{#note}}
现在，在 Meteor 中被打包的模板只有 Handlebars。请让我们知道：在 Meteor 中，
你想使用什么模板系统。同时，请看 [Handlebars documentation](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/)
和 [Meteor Handlebars extensions](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Handlebars)
{{/note}}

一个 `name` 属性为 `hello` 的模板会调用函数 `Template.hello` 来渲染，
然后传递模板中的所有数据：

    <!-- in myapp.html -->
    <template name="hello">
      <div class="greeting">Hello there, {{dstache}}first}} {{dstache}}last}}!</div>
    </{{! }}template>

    // in the JavaScript console
    > Template.hello({first: "Alyssa", last: "Hacker"});
     => "<div class="greeting">Hello there, Alyssa Hacker!</div>"

这会返回一个字符串。要想把模板与 [`Live HTML`](#livehtml) 系统一同
使用，并在适当位置自动更新获取到的 DOM 元素，请用
[`Meteor.render`](#meteor_render)：

    Meteor.render(function () {
      return Template.hello({first: "Alyssa", last: "Hacker"});
    })
      => automatically updating DOM elements

获取模板中的数据的最简单的方法是在 JavaScript 中定义辅助函数。只要在
`Template.[template name]` 对象中直接加入辅助函数就可以了。例如，在这个
模板中：

    <template name="players">
      {{dstache}}#each topScorers}}
        <div>{{dstache}}name}}</div>
      {{dstache}}/each}}
    </{{! }}template>

我们可以通过定义函数 `Template.players`，来更换当传递数据
`topScorers` 时所调用模板函数：

    Template.players.topScorers = function () {
      return Users.find({score: {$gt: 100}}, {sort: {score: -1}});
    };

在这个实例中，数据来自数据库查询。一旦数据库游标传递给 `#each`，就会
高效地连接每一台机器，添加和移动 DOM 节点作为新的结果输入查询中。

辅助对象可以带参数，然后它们将收到在 `this` 函数中的当前模板的数据：

    // in a JavaScript file
    Template.players.leagueIs = function (league) {
      return this.league === league;
    };

    <!-- in a HTML file -->
    <template name="players">
      {{dstache}}#each topScorers}}
        {{dstache}}#if leagueIs "junior"}}
          <div>Junior: {{dstache}}name}}</div>
        {{dstache}}/if}}
        {{dstache}}#if leagueIs "senior"}}
          <div>Senior: {{dstache}}name}}</div>
        {{dstache}}/if}}
      {{dstache}}/each}}
    </{{! }}template>

{{#note}}
关于 Handlebars 的提示： `{{dstache}}#if leagueIs "junior"}}` 是可以使用的，
因为 Meteor 扩展模块允许在一个块辅助对象中嵌套一个辅助对象。（`if` 和
`leagueIs` 都是严格意义上的辅助对象，标准的 Handlebars 模板不会在这里调用
`leagueIs` 函数。
{{/note}}

辅助对象也可以用来传递常量数据。

    // Works fine with {{dstache}}#each sections}}
    Template.report.sections = ["Situation", "Complication", "Resolution"];

最后，你可以在一个模板函数中使用一个 `events` 声明来建立一个事件处理函数表，这个
格式被记录在 [Event Maps](#eventmaps)。事件处理函数的 `this` 参数会成为触发事件
元素中的数据上下文。

    <!-- myapp.html -->
    <template name="scores">
      {{dstache}}#each player}}
        {{dstache}}> playerScore}}
      {{dstache}}/each}}
    </{{! }}template>

    <template name="playerScore">
      <div>{{dstache}}name}}: {{dstache}}score}}
        <span class="givePoints">Give points</span>
      </div>
    </{{! }}template>

    <!-- myapp.js -->
    Template.playerScore.events({
      'click .givePoints': function () {
        Users.update(this._id, {$inc: {score: 2}});
      }
    });

把它们整理在一起，这就是一个关于你如何在你的模板中注入任意数据、并在数据
改变时自动更新它们的例子。更多讨论请看 [Live HTML](#livehtml)。

    <!-- in myapp.html -->
    <template name="forecast">
      <div>It'll be {{dstache}}prediction}} tonight</div>
    </{{! }}template>

    <!-- in myapp.js -->
    // JavaScript: reactive helper function
    Template.forecast.prediction = function () {
      return Session.get("weather");
    };

    <!-- in the console -->
    > Session.set("weather", "cloudy");
    > document.body.appendChild(Meteor.render(Template.forecast));
    In DOM:  <div>It'll be cloudy tonight</div>

    > Session.set("weather", "cool and dry");
    In DOM:  <div>It'll be cool and dry tonight</div>

<template name="packages_concept">
{{#better_markdown}}

  <h2 id="smartpackages">Smart packages</h2>

Meteor has an unusually powerful package system. All of the
functionality you've read about so far is implemented as standard
Meteor packages.

Meteor packages are intelligent: the packages are themselves
JavaScript programs. They can inject code into the client or the
server, or hook new functions into the bundler, so they can extend the
Meteor environment in arbitrary ways. Some examples of packages are:

* The [coffeescript](#coffeescript) package extends the
  bundler, automatically compiling any `.coffee` files in
  your tree.  Once added, you can write your application in CoffeeScript
  instead of JavaScript.

* The [jQuery](#jquery) and [Backbone](#backbone) packages are examples of using
  Meteor to prepackage client JavaScript libraries. You could get
  the same result by copying the JavaScript files into your tree, but
  it's faster to add a package.

* The [underscore](#underscore) package extends both the
  client and server environments.

Many of the core Meteor features,
including Minimongo, the Session object, and reactive Handlebars
templates, are implemented as internal packages automatically
included with every Meteor application.

You can see a list of available packages
with [`meteor list`](#meteorlist), add packages to your project
with [`meteor add`](#meteoradd), and remove them
with [`meteor remove`](#meteorremove).

See the [Package List](#packages) section for a description
of the existing packages.

{{#warning}}
The package API is rapidly changing and isn't documented, so you can't
make your own packages just yet. Coming soon.

<template name="deploying">
{{#better_markdown}}

<h2 id="deploying">Deploying</h2>

Meteor is a full application server.  We include everything you need
to deploy your application on the internet: you just provide the JavaScript,
HTML, and CSS.

<h3 class="nosection">Running on Meteor's infrastructure</h3>

The easiest way to deploy your application is to use `meteor
deploy`.  We provide it because it's what, personally, we've always
wanted: an easy way to take an app idea, flesh it out over a weekend,
and put it out there for the world to use, with nothing getting in the
way of creativity.

    $ meteor deploy myapp.meteor.com

Your application is now available at myapp.meteor.com.  If
this is the first time deploying to this hostname, Meteor creates a
fresh empty database for your application.  If you want to deploy an
update, Meteor will preserve the existing data and just refresh the
code.

You can also deploy to your own domain.  Just set up the hostname you
want to use as a CNAME to `origin.meteor.com`,
then deploy to that name.

    $ meteor deploy www.myapp.com

We provide this as a free service so you can try Meteor.  It is also
helpful for quickly putting up internal betas, demos, and so on.

<h3 class="nosection">Running on your own infrastructure</h3>

You can also run your application on your own infrastructure, or any
other hosting provider like Heroku.

To get started, run

    $ meteor bundle myapp.tgz

This command will generate a fully-contained Node.js application in
the form of a tarball.  To run this application, you need to provide
Node.js 0.8 and a MongoDB server.  You can then run the application by
invoking node, specifying the HTTP port for the application to listen
on, and the MongoDB endpoint.  If you don't already have a MongoDB
server, we can recommend our friends at [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com).

    $ PORT=3000 MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp node bundle/main.js

Other packages may require other environment variables (for example, the `email`
package requires a `MAIL_URL` environment variable).

{{#warning}}
For now, bundles will only run on the platform that the bundle was
created on.  To run on a different platform, you'll need to rebuild
the native packages included in the bundle.  To do that, make sure you
have `npm` available, and run the following:

    $ cd bundle/server/node_modules
    $ rm -r fibers
    $ npm install fibers@1.0.0
{{/warning}}
